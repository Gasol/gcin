Use the following command to get DFSG source tarball

    debina/rules get-orig-source

This command will download upstream tarball, remove dayi3.cin related code due
to non DFSG license, and remove gcin-*.tar.xz to avoid
source-contains-unsafe-symlink.

Currently get-orig-source cannot generate identical tarball when upstream
version is the same.
